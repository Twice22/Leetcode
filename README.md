# Some leetcode solutions

In the life of a man there are these moments where you make a promise.
On May 18th I made the promise that during the next 11 months, I'll
brush my Skill in:

+ Python, Go, C++
+ Algorithms

I'm a man of my word. This repository serves as a track on my path to
becoming of better programmer.


Most of the time people only post the solution to the problems without detailing
what was the reflection process. I think the most important thing is not to know
how to translate an algorithm into a piece of code bur rather how to think in
order to find a good solution in term of __time__ and __space__ Complexity.

So, for each solution of a specific leetcode problem, I will not only provide
a workable piece of code but I will also try to detail as much as possible how did
I come up with that specific solution.
